mxiostat \- A version of iostat that actually reports real numbers taken straight from the kernel.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY mxiostat
.OP \-qvaH
.OP \-D DEV,...
.OP \-c COUNT
.RI [[DEV|FIELD,...]
.RI [DELAY]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mxiostat
is a version of iostat that actually reports real numbers taken straight
from the kernel. This uses the 2.6 /proc/diskstats stuff.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B -q
Don't print the periodic header.
.TP
.B -v
Be more verbose in some situations.
.TP
.BI -c COUNT

.TP
.B -a
Report on particular stat(s) for all disks, instead of all stats for
one disk
.TP
.B -C
Compact reporting for multiple fields in
.B -a
mode ; all fields for all disks are printed on one line.
.TP
.B -V
\'Vertical\' report for multiple disks in -a mode, where each disk is
printed on one line
.TP
.BI -D DEV,...
In

In 
.B -a
, exclude these devices from the report
.TP
